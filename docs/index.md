### How do I read this wiki?

!!! danger "Caution"

    Do not literally type out `< >` `[ ]` `|` etc.

    `<>` means you change it so your specific server/needs, like `<message>` , `<channel>` , etc.

    `[]` means the different options you can use ** Don't use them all, its only one of them that you need**.

    `|` seperates the said options. Commonly used to denote different arguments or different aliases of the same command, eg:  `bb [setup|set]`.

Each category of commands has their own page which can be found on the sidebar.

-   **Aliases**: [foo|bar] means that you can use either foo or bar.
-   **Optional**: [foo] means that this argument can be ignored.
-   **Optional with default**: [foo='muted'] means that it will default to the value if you don't specify anything else
-   **Required**: <foo\> means that you must use this argument for the command to work
    <!-- "Many" is not being used right now.  -->
    <!-- - **Many**: <foos...> or [foos...] means that you can specify more than one -->

!!! info
