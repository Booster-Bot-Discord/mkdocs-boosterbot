### How do I read this wiki?

!!! danger "Caution"

    Do not literally type out `< >` `[ ]` `|` etc.

Each category of commands has its own page, which can be found on the sidebar.

-   **Aliases**: [foo|bar] means that you can use either foo or bar.
-   **Optional**: [foo] means that this argument can be ignored.
-   **Optional with default**: [foo='muted'] means that it will default to the value if you don't specify anything else.
-   **Required**: <foo\> means that you must use this argument for the command to work.
    <!-- "Many" is not being used right now.  -->
    <!-- - **Many**: <foos...> or [foos...] means that you can specify more than one -->
